It's a simple JS library that uses jQuery alike architecture (also supports/ includes jQuery, but that's besides the point :)). 
It allows you to set up various greetings (login) messages (regular and formal ones).
And display them to the user and the developer too (I'm talking about the console, but you already knew that :)).
